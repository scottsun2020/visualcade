Below is Game Pitch

Name of Game: Terragrasp
Name of Team: VisualCade

September 1st, 2022
Logline:
You are a brave human combatant who accepts missions requiring you to reclaim enemy-held territories on distant planets by defeating creatures and reestablishing the area’s communication with Earth.

Story:
In the year 2050, artificial territories on distant planets have been invaded by unknown creatures. Every area’s communication has been severed and no signals are sent back to Earth. You are chosen to be the most talented and brave human being sent to defeat the enemy and take back these embezzled lands.

Gameplay:
Terragrasp is an action beat ‘em up game, which is played from a third-person perspective. The player is able to move their character around, fight enemies, and collect power ups. Power ups are scattered around the level, and when collected, can be used to temporarily make the player powerful against groups of enemies. In addition, the player is able to use abilities that have cooldowns to ensure game balance. There are different enemy types who will utilize either close-range or long-range attacks against the player. The player will also earn experience from defeating enemies and will be able to choose a stat to improve upon leveling up. Level completion can be achieved by defeating all the enemies and the final boss, which will spawn in the level after 5 minutes have passed. 

Technology:
There will be many types of enemies with different approaches to defeating the player, requiring different code structures to be created since they define enemy behavior.

The player will be able to level up their character, improving their offense/defense stats. This will require us to develop code that checks when players have earned a certain number of experience.

A two-player feature can be achieved after the single player mode is completely implemented. The two-player mode only exists during the boss fight sequence.

There will be power ups that provide a temporary advantage for the player when dealing with a large number of enemies. This will require a power up spawn system, as well additional scripts that will change the player’s behavior when the item is picked up.
